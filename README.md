# Kappa-Kappa-Psi-Statistics
I am a brother of Kappa Kappa Psi, the professional band-service fraternity at UIUC! While I was pledging, I had to create a project that represented Kappa Kappa Psi, but also included a creative twist. For my project, I created a DataFrame that includes everyone in Kappa Kappa Psi. I aim to not only identify current members but also include those who are alumni, as well as individuals in the Membership Candidate (MC) process. This dataset will enable me to conduct statistical analyses to explore various aspects of Kappa Kappa Psi. To me, this dataset represents our brotherhood, as we are all part of this collective unit, each contributing a unique and special role.
